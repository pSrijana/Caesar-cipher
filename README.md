# What is Caesar Cipher Technique?
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”. The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption techniques. It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

# Features of Caesar Cipher
Substitution cipher: The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
1) Fixed key: 
The Caesar cipher uses a fixed key, which is the number of positions by which the letters are shifted. This key is known to both the sender and the receiver.
2) Symmetric encryption: 
The Caesar cipher is a symmetric encryption technique, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
3) Limited keyspace: 
The Caesar cipher has a very limited keyspace of only 26 possible keys, as there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet.
4) Vulnerable to brute force attacks: 
The Caesar cipher is vulnerable to brute force attacks, as there are only 26 possible keys to try.
5) Easy to implement: 
The Caesar cipher is very easy to implement and requires only simple arithmetic operations, making it a popular choice for simple encryption tasks.
